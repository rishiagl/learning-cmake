# Learning-CMake

## What is CMake? 

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

## Why learn CMake?

Just learn it bro, it'll save you a lot(hell-lot) of time!

## Where to learn?

Youtube channel: [**vector of bool**](https://www.youtube.com/@vector-of-bool1005
),
### Why this particular channel?
This guy is the creator of CMake-Tools, a CMake extension for "The VS Code"; therefore his teaching is the most valuble resource for learning CMake, obviously after the creators of CMake! And his teaching style is one the best I have come across youtube.

## Who Am I?
Just a random guy learning to use cmake so decided to help the community by creating a git repo for reference which he did'nt(The youtubers seems to be lazy:).

## How to navigate this repo?
Each coding episode has been documented is seperate branch with its episode prefix as branch name, just navigate through branches as you watch episode's.

## Copy-right and disclaimer:
I do not own the rights of any of the code or tools used in this repo they owned by vector-of-bool or the tools creators.

## Branch details:

### 0b:

Everyone knows about the "cmake" command, but do you know about "cmake-gui"? What about "ccmake"? These are all different ways of running CMake, and I'll show each one in this video.

Another basic video. No addenda or errata here, because this video is literally perfect.

If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with autotools and has worked with software in the past ten years, you may be entitled to financial compensation.

### 1a:

**A "Hello, world" executable**
Wow! We're doing something real in this one!

It may seem basic, but I hope to always touch on aspects of CMake that aren't common knowledge. For example, did you know about CMake's --build argument?

No addenda or errata yet. This video is flawless and perfect.

If you experience any disorientation while viewing, remove your 3D glasses and close your eyes until you feel well again.
